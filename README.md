# Energy-Forecast-Prediction

Welcome to the repository for my university coursework in data analysis and energy forecasting. This coursework was completed as part of my studies at IIT for the course Machien Learning during the 2nd year year.

## Course Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for two main objectives of the coursework:

### Objective 1: Partitioning Clustering

In this part of the coursework, I explored partitioning clustering techniques on a dataset related to vehicle silhouettes. The objectives included:

- Pre-processing tasks, including scaling and outliers detection/removal.
- Determining the number of cluster centers using automated tools.
- Performing k-means clustering analysis with various input variables.
- Evaluating clustering results using internal evaluation metrics like silhouette score.
- Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and repeating clustering analysis.
- Implementing and discussing the Calinski-Harabasz index for cluster evaluation.

The code and detailed documentation for this objective can be found in the `Partitioning_Clustering` folder.

### Objective 2: Energy Forecasting with Multilayer Neural Networks (MLP)

In this part of the coursework, I worked on energy consumption forecasting using a multilayer neural network (MLP). The goals included:

- Exploring different input vector schemes for MLP models in electricity load forecasting.
- Implementing one-step-ahead forecasting using the autoregressive (AR) approach.
- Expanding the forecasting model by incorporating information from previous hours (NARX).
- Normalizing data for MLP training.
- Creating and comparing various MLP models with different architectures and input vectors.
- Evaluating MLP models using statistical indices like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE.
- Discussing the efficiency and preference of different network structures.

The code and detailed documentation for this objective can be found in the `Energy_Forecasting` folder.
